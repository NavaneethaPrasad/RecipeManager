Recipe Manager & Meal Planner

The Recipe Manager & Meal Planner is a backend application designed to help users organize their cooking and meal planning in a simple and efficient way. The system allows users to create and manage their own recipes, plan meals for specific dates, automatically generate shopping lists, and scale recipes based on required servings.

The application starts with user authentication, ensuring that each user can securely access and manage only their own data. Once logged in, users can create recipes by adding ingredients with quantities and units, along with step-by-step cooking instructions. These recipes can be updated or deleted as needed.

A meal planning feature allows users to schedule recipes for specific dates and meal types such as breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The system prevents duplicate meal plans for the same date and meal type, helping users maintain an organized plan.

Based on the planned meals, users can generate a shopping list for a selected date range. The system automatically aggregates ingredients from all planned recipes and combines quantities of the same ingredients, making grocery shopping easier. Users can also mark shopping list items as checked once they are purchased.

The application also includes a recipe scaling feature, which allows users to adjust ingredient quantities according to the number of servings they want to prepare. This helps in cooking for different group sizes without manually recalculating quantities.

Overall, the project focuses on clean backend design, business logic separation, and testable services, making it suitable for real-world use cases such as personal meal planning or as a backend service for a food-related application.
